# toolbag
A lightweight JavaScript utility library built entirely with functions.

Toolbag is a collection of small, reusable, and beginner-friendly helper functions for everyday JavaScript tasks.
It’s designed as a learning project for mastering functions (declarations, expressions, and arrow functions), while also giving you a handy “toolbag” of utilities you can reuse in any project.

Features:

Functions only - no classes, no frameworks.

Covers math, arrays, strings, objects, async, and functional programming.

Shows practical patterns: closures, currying, memoization, debounce, throttle, pipe, compose.

Pure and reusable helpers (no mutation by default).

Small and easy to extend - add your own tools to the bag.
